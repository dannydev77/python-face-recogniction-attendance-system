# Python face recognition attendance system

Facial recognition ,  a technology that uses human facial features to identify them.
- For this reason I decided to create my own app to meet these goals
- The system is created in python using the haarcascade_classifier_default (can be found on opencv website)

It utilizes computer vision algorithms to detect, train the datasets.

 - This is a simple system that alloes users to select a course and after application,  they will receive an email confirmation.
 - The system will also allow users to be advised based on selected course
 - A user can view his/her profile with summary of their detail and later on generate a report for themselves

## Project pitfalls and workaround
So this might sound dumb, but the project had already been finished and an installer for it created. 
- This means you did not need to have python in your system. all was required was the installer (an executable)
- the support was only for windows os
However, I had made a mistake of not uploading the finished code on github and apparently formatted my computer losing all files in the process.
Thus the need to keep it active and I started from where this code had left.
- With time I will finish it again and upload the installer on my website for testing
## Plan and progres
- Still in development
- Recreated a fresh

### Tools used
1. Numpy
2. PyQt5 - a Python wrapper for Qt
3. OpenCv-python
